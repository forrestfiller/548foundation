										<h2>Lower building carbon emissions & individual unit utility bills by 33%</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>Buildings are the largest contributor to CO2 emissions and this is especially true in outdated structures. These buildings' show their inefficiencies by the high utility costs passed on to residents. We want to remove this additional burden by updating existing structures and also new construction of environmentally conscious multi-unit buildings. Removing the additional burden of high energy costs that are passed onto the tenants, while also making a positive impact on the environment.</li>
											<br />
											<li>Buildings account for 39% of the US total CO2 emissions.</li>
											<br />
											<li>Buildings consume 70% of the electricity load in the US.</li>
